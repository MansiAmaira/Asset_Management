- Loading states and error handling

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI (Radix UI primitives)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Backend Integration**: Express proxy to Spring Boot API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js 20 or higher
2. Your Spring Boot backend running (default: `http://localhost:8080`)

### Installation

The project is already set up in Replit. All dependencies are installed automatically.

### Configuration

Set the Spring Boot backend URL (if different from default):

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (see `.env.example`)
2. Set `SPRING_BOOT_URL` to your Spring Boot backend URL

```env
SPRING_BOOT_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Running the Application

The application runs automatically in Replit. To manually start:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- Frontend development server (Vite) on port 5000
- Express proxy server that forwards API requests to Spring Boot

### Connecting to Spring Boot Backend

The Express server acts as a proxy to your Spring Boot backend:

1. Ensure your Spring Boot application is running
2. The proxy forwards all `/api/*` requests to `http://localhost:8080` (or your configured URL)
3. All cookies, authentication headers, and CSRF tokens are properly forwarded
4. The proxy handles CORS automatically

### Spring Boot Backend Requirements

Your Spring Boot backend should have these endpoints (as shown in the provided controllers):

#### Employee Endpoints
- `GET /employees` - Get all employees
- `GET /employees/{id}` - Get employee by ID
- `POST /employees` - Create employee
- `PUT /employees/{id}` - Update employee
- `DELETE /employees/{id}` - Delete employee
- `GET /employees/active` - Get active employees

#### Asset Endpoints
- `GET /assets` - Get all assets
- `GET /assets/paginated` - Get paginated assets
- `GET /assets/{id}` - Get asset by ID
- `POST /assets` - Create asset
- `PUT /assets/{id}` - Update asset
- `DELETE /assets/{id}` - Delete asset
- `GET /assets/statistics` - Get asset statistics
- `GET /assets/statistics/by-type` - Get assets count by type

#### Assignment Endpoints
- `GET /assignments` - Get all assignments
- `POST /assignments/assign` - Assign asset to employee
- `PUT /assignments/return/{id}` - Return asset
- `GET /assignments/asset/{assetId}` - Get asset assignment history
- `GET /assignments/employee/{employeeId}` - Get employee assignment history

## Development

### State Management

The application uses Redux Toolkit for state management with separate slices:

- `employeeSlice` - Employee data and operations
- `assetSlice` - Asset data, pagination, and filters
- `assignmentSlice` - Assignment operations and history
- `dashboardSlice` - Statistics and analytics

### Type Safety

All types are defined in `shared/schema.ts` and match the Spring Boot entities:

- `Employee` / `InsertEmployee`
- `Asset` / `InsertAsset`
- `AssignmentHistory` / `AssignmentRequest`
- Enums for Status, Condition, etc.

### Adding New Features

1. Define types in `shared/schema.ts`
2. Create Redux slice in `client/src/store/slices/`
3. Build UI components in `client/src/components/`
4. Create page in `client/src/pages/`
5. Add route in `client/src/App.tsx`

## Testing

The application includes:

- TypeScript type checking
- Form validation with Zod schemas
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Loading states for async operations
- Test IDs on all interactive elements (data-testid)

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Connection Issues

If you see "Backend service unavailable" errors:

1. Verify your Spring Boot backend is running
2. Check the backend URL in `.env` or default `http://localhost:8080`
3. Ensure CORS is properly configured in Spring Boot
4. Check the Express proxy logs for connection errors

### Authentication Issues

If authentication fails:

1. Ensure your Spring Boot app uses session cookies
2. Check that Spring Security allows the proxy origin
3. Verify CSRF tokens are properly configured

### UI Issues

1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

## Contributing

1. Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
2. Use existing Shadcn components when possible
3. Follow the design guidelines in `design_guidelines.md`
4. Add proper error handling and loading states
5. Include data-testid attributes for interactive elements
